# 💊 Pharmaceutical Drug Sales Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **analyzing pharmaceutical sales data** to uncover insights into **revenue trends, units sold, customer behavior, and regional performance**.  

We integrate **SQL (MySQL Workbench)** for querying and data extraction with **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)** for analysis, visualization, and forecasting.  
This project simulates the type of analytical work performed by data teams in **pharmaceutical analytics and consulting firms**.

## 📊 Dataset
**Source:** [Kaggle – Sample Pharmaceutical Drug Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com)  
The dataset contains information on:
- Drug name and manufacturer  
- Sales region and customer type  
- Units sold and total revenue  
- Monthly timestamps for time-series analysis  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🧮 Use **SQL queries** to extract and prepare datasets for analysis  
- 💰 Analyze **revenue across regions, manufacturers, and customer segments**  
- 💊 Identify **top-selling drugs** and their sales trends over time  
- 📅 Explore **monthly sales patterns** to inform marketing strategy  
- 🔮 Forecast **next 6 months of revenue** using regression models  
- 📈 Deliver **visual insights** that support data-driven decision-making
